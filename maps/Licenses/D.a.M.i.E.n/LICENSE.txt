Note of an author:This map has been created in the year 2011-2012. The base idea 
is a connection of several design works in one  harmonious complex,  that  could 
be imagined like a place unto the future/parallel world with calming  atmosphere
or just some hidden place on Earth.  For more info,  your  questions or  if  you
just like this map, and you feel to tell a few words,  please contact me  on  my 
e-mail: "damiendark@email.cz". Thank you to all who  helped with testing and for 
support, especially to "Princess", "Kpt. Blaubaer", "Master Chief", "something", 
"idk" and "Fallen", to mappers, especially to "TristamK",  "4t3one"  and "4rson" for advices, 
(sorry if I forgot someone) and thank you to them who likes this work.    Damien
