1.3.2 small additions:
- added grass to the destructed ground
- changed some lights, no groundbreaking changes

1.3.1 small additions:
- all portals have sounds now (not really necessary, because you heard the sound already from the portal you leaved - but so it's perfect)
- removed the defend-flag from the middle 


changelog since 1.2:
----------------------
- decent retexturing
- fixed portal issues, had to rebuild some geometry details for that, ...
- boxes: rearranged them, deleted some of them, rounded some edges, everything in order to fit the players movementabilities
- added more clips for the same reason
- added more weapon spawns
- decent changes on graphics, some additional details
- changed the position of the blue flag
- added flag holders for all four teams 
- added waypoints for bots and deleted some, tried to better the wayfinding routines 
- diverse changes on lighting - very decent

no issues known at the moment


_______________
changelog since 1.1:
- added and changed Textures
- added many many lightsources - impossible to count them
- changed some geometric details e.g. on buildings
- added some screen details
- added a new underground area with two generators, wich are only reachable over two hidden, but easy to find portals
- added 6 teleporters, all in all the map has 10 portals now, some are double linked
- changed the water area, now it is possible to leave it without jumping over the stairs
- added many clips and changed the clip box around the level: it`s not possible, to go behind the buildings again 
- added particle effects: some smoke and a huge lightnig to the generators
- added team screens: I didn't want to add classical teamcolours to the map, according to it's asymmetrical layout and whole design; I use screens for team alpha and omega instead
- added spawning- pads for the weapons
- ... many other details 

known Issues:
- teleporters: sometimes the sound is not to hear; sometimes you'll be ported in the near of the secred area instead of inside;   sometimes you'll be ported two times for and back - it is one of the double linked portal - difficult to solve this
- botpathing is not perfect
- texturing could still be better sometimes
