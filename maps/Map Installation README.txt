To install maps downloaded from this folder on Windows, you must copy and paste the files from this directory to:

(Documents/My Games/Red Eclipse/maps)

The easiest way to do this is to simply drag the "data" folder into the Red Eclipse folder. When given the prompt, you must click "Yes" to merge the files in this folder with the ones in your current game directory.

Enjoy!
